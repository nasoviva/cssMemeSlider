<p align="center">A project involves creating a functional image slider using only CSS,
without any JavaScript. The slider showcases a collection of memes that
can automatically switch or be manually controlled via navigation
elements. The main challenge of the project is to leverage CSS
capabilities to manage transitions, image display, and navigation. This
project highlights a creative approach to achieving interactivity without
relying on scripts.</p>
